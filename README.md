# To do:

# To check:

for preprocessing I use f_lp = 32 Hz for EEG and f_lp = 64 for envelopes. Later this this.

- Normalization of EEG data: normalization across the whole samplel? across channels? across time points?

# To do

- temporal information in the embedding can be destroyed in the last layer or depthwise layer.


- testing on spatial attention detection


- Grid search over different model structures
