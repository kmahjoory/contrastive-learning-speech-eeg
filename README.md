# To do:

# To check:

for preprocessing I use f_lp = 32 Hz for EEG and f_lp = 64 for envelopes. Later this this.

- Normalization of EEG data: normalization across the whole samplel? across channels? across time points?

# To do

- Implement sampler for batch, maybe torch dataloader
- implement validation inside the training loop
- implement gpu functionality
- swithc to more advanced optimizer
- set optimial learning rate
- code testing on test set
- testing on spatial attention detection
